React Server Components

RSC introduces two new ways of creating React components, splitting them into two types

- Server components
in nextsjs, all components are server components by default
they have the ability to run tasks like reading files or fetchind data from a database
they don't have the ability to use hooks or handle user interactions

- Client components
to create a client component, it's necessary to add "use client" at the top of the component file
client components can't perform tasks like reading files, but they have the ability to use hooks and manage interactions


Routing

Next has a file system based routing
URL paths that users can access in the browser are defined by files and folders in your codebase

Routing conventions
all routes must be placed inside the app folder
every file that corresponds to a route must be named page.tsx 
every folder corresponds to a path segmenet in the browser URL

Nested routes
